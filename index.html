          Every school has a canteen and it makes it easy for students to get food from these canteens.

          On a busy day when mothers don’t get time to pack lunchboxes or snack boxes, these canteens are really handy
          and a lifesaver.Our school also has a canteen. The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at
          a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would
          require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in
          school.Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based
          on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students
          needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would
          almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.Our canteen provides all kinds of
          food. You would get the vegetarian food and the non-vegetarian food. You have the rice varieties which may
          include the normal meals or fried rice and also fast food kind of items which includes sandwiches, rolls,
          wraps, burgers etc.

          Even soft drinks and packet juices are provided. You just need to choose which food you would like to have and
          pay accordingly. The canteen food is very tasty and it is very neat. The food is all sealed and served in
          packets, so that it makes it easy to carry around and have food. There is a canteen in-charge that takes care
          of the quality of the food and the neatness of the canteen.

A modern-day playground
A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors. While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities. A playground might exclude children below a certain age.

Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development. Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.

Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball.

Public playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use.

A type of playground called a playscape is designed to provide a safe environment for play in a natural setting.
